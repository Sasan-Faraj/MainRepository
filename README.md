<h3 align="center"><a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/RegressionFinalProject/"> Automating Linear Regression (OLS) Tasks in Python</a></h3>
<h4 align="Center"> December 2023 </h4>

<p align="Left">
This project is an extension of my final for my graduate Regression class. I leverage Python to perform an Ordinary Least Squares Analysis on the total contract amount of active roster contract amounts for the NFL team Commanders. For the course, I used a commercial software called Minitab, this project aims to demonstrate how I can build up the same tools in a freely available coding language. 

Namely, I build functions to perform statistical based residual analysis and an OLS run, standardize continuous variables, create interaction terms, and perform a forward stepwise collection (recursively defined) for feature selection. I include elements of theory and results. <a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/RegressionFinalProject/RegressionFunctions.html"> Here</a> is a link to the functions I wrote that support the analysis linked in the heading.

<h4 align="Center"> December 2023 </h4>

<p align="Left">
This project is an extension of my graduate independent research, studying what led certain states to have more clinical trial sites per clinical trial compared to other states, as it relates to diabetic clinical trials.

I performed data joining from multiple government and private resources. Though this specific visualization does not contain analysis, I ended up leveraging OLS for my final analysis. I created the visualization above to demonstrate how visualizations be useful for modeling. My advisor at the time for the project was Professor Ninh at William and Mary.

<h3 align="center"><a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/DataSubsetting_GPOAnalysis/"> Creating a Subsetting Template and Tutorial for the Government Publishing Organization</a></h3>
<h4 align="Center">February - May 2023. Published October 2023 </h4>

<p align="Left">
Focusing on educating people on efficient data handling, I created an R-script for research librarians across the America to use and learn from. This script brings in data, subsets it, and export out that data. With a variety of different use cases, librarians are able to adjust the subsetting as they see fit or even add to them.

 This task was done for the The Depository Library Council which is an oversight comittee of the U.S. Government Publishing Organization. My contribution was cited within <a href = "https://fdlp.gov/sites/default/files/file_repo/dlc-covid19-fdlp-impact-first-report-10132023.pdf"> this whitepaper</a> and my work was posted to <a href="https://www.fdlp.gov/file-repository/988/r-data-analysis-q6-2021-biennial-survey"> this website</a>.

<h4 align="Center">May 2023</h4>
<p align = "left">
  Expanding upon a study's static heat map of clinical trials relating to diabetic eye diseases in the US, I created an web application to enhance the visualization, allowing for users to interact with the map. Users have the capability to scroll in and out of the map, select one or more trials, and view the details of the trial. 
<br>
<br>
  This project leveraged techniques in local data preprocessing, cloud based data management, geocoding, and mapping techniques. The softwares and languages relied on were ArcGIS Online for display and layer hosting with prep

<h3 align="center"><a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/SatelliteReliability/"> Fitting large satellite, right-censored failure data with covariates to the Weibull distribution</a></h3>
<h4 align="Center">May 2023</h4>

<p align="Left">
  This project was the final project for my graduate class, Reliability. The goal for project was to find a method to model satellite failure and provide estimates on the failure rates and mean time to failur for large satellites, accounting for covariates. I expanded on methodologies within the literature by focusing on covariates. This is critical as products are not used within a vaccuum, rather in conjunction to other factors. 
<br>
 <br>
  I incorporated open sourced data, as detailed in the report. This project and presentation was for educational advancement purposes.

<h3 align="center"><a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/SoyBeanDiseaseClassification/"> Supervised Classification Methodologies Given Class Imbalances</a></h3>
<h4 align="Center">December 2022</h4>

<p align="Left">
  Leveraging soybean disease classification and plant informational data, I compared the the results of two supervised classification methods: Multivariate Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regression. The data had 19 classes, 35 features, 306 instances, and 712 missing values.
<br>
 <br>
  The purpose of this analysis, rather than simply obtaining the highest accuracy, is to demonstrate the different methodologies and concepts that need to be thought about for implementation of supervised learning classification models. Namely, I touch on data imputation, sampling, and hyperparameter tuning methodologies. I also took this project further to identify key features for prediction as to mimic the business case of finding the most important factor for a given target of an analysis. We want to know why a process is happening in order to create solutions for it.
