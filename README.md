<p align = "left">
  Expanding upon a study's static heat map of clinical trials relating to diabetic eye diseases in the US, I created an web application to enhance the visualization, allowing for users to interact with the map. Users have the capability to scroll in and out of the map, select one or more trials, and view the details of the trial.

  This project leveraged techniques in local data preprocessing, cloud based data management, geocoding, and mapping techniques. The softwares and languages relied on were ArcGIS Online for display and layer hosting with prep

<h3 align="center"><a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/DataSubsetting_GPOAnalysis/"> Creating a Subsetting Template and Tutorial for the Government Publishing Organization.</a></h3>
<p align="Left">
Focusing on educating people on efficient data handling, I created an R-script for research librarians across the America to use and learn from. This script brings in data, subsets it, and export out that data. With a variety of different use cases, librarians are able to adjust the subsetting as they see fit or even add to them.

 This task was done for the The Depository Library Council which is an oversight comittee of the U.S. Government Publishing Organization. Though currently hosted on my own repository, the file will soon be hosted on the GPO's repository.

<h3 align="center"><a href ="https://sasan-faraj.github.io/MainRepository/"> Supervised Classification Methodologies Given Class Imbalances.</a></h3>
<p align="Left">
  Leverage soybean disease status and plant informational data, I compared the the results of two supervised classification methods: Multivariate Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regression. The data had 19 classes, 35 features, 306 instances, and 712 missing values. I implement and comment on data imputation methodologies, sampling methodologies, and performing a gridsearchCV for efficiency of hyperparameter testing.
  
  I also did a deep dive into the strongest predictors of the diseas status. Though we want accuracy, we want to know why a process is happening in order to creat solutions for it. Further logic and writing can be found in the code.
